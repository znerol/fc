fc - Floating Point Calculator

Fc is the result of a students project in scope of the 2010 fall term lecture
Automata and Formal languages at University of Applied Science Berne.

The floating point calculator consists of a lexer and different types of
parsers matching the following grammar (EBNF):

    Statement ->  'let' Identifier '=' Expr | 'exit' | Expr
    Expr -> Term { ('+'|'-') Term }
    Term -> Factor { ('*'|'/') Factor }
    Factor -> '(' Expr ')' | [ '-' ] ( Num | Identifier )
    
    Num is a real number (without exposant) and Identifier is a sequence of
    letters.

Two parser implementations must be realized, one using JavaCC and another one
implemented without the help of third party java frameworks.
